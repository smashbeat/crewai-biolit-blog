    - TL;DR (3 bullets)
    - Key claims (with page refs)
    - Methods (short)

    Using the notes, write a blog post:
    - 900–1200 words
    - Intro framing the question/problem
    - H2/H3 sections
    - Inline citations like [p.12]
    - Short “Why it matters”
    - “Further reading” (3 items)
    IMPORTANT: Return pure Markdown only. Do NOT use triple backticks or code fences anywhere (including FAQs).
